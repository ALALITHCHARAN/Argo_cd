Here's a **complete, real-world example** based on your request:

---

## 🎯 Scenario

* Microservice: `orders`

* Git Repo layout:

  ```
  a/
  └── b/
      └── yamls/
          ├── deployment.yaml
          ├── service.yaml
          ├── ingress.yaml
          ├── configmap.yaml
          ├── kustomization.yaml
  common/
  └── base/
      └── envconfigmap.yaml  <-- This is shared (goes two directories up from yamls/)
  ```

* Git branch: `brn`

* Kubernetes namespace: `NSR`

* Argo CD installed in: `argocd`

---

## ✅ 1. `kustomization.yaml`

📁 Location: `a/b/yamls/kustomization.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

resources:
  - deployment.yaml
  - service.yaml
  - ingress.yaml
  - configmap.yaml
  - ../../../common/base/envconfigmap.yaml  # goes 2 directories up
```

✅ This structure means:

* 4 resources are in the **same directory**
* 1 shared config is pulled from **two levels up**

---

## ✅ 2. `application.yaml` for Argo CD

📁 You can apply this in the `argocd` namespace (via Git or `kubectl`)

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: orders-app
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://git.example.com/your-org/microservices.git
    targetRevision: brn               # The branch you mentioned
    path: a/b/yamls                   # This is the folder with kustomization.yaml
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: NSR                    # Deploying services into this namespace
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
```

---

## 🧪 Test It

1. Commit all files to your Git repo under branch `brn`
2. Apply the `Application`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f application.yaml -n argocd
```

3. In the Argo CD UI, you’ll see `orders-app` syncing to the `NSR` namespace
4. Argo CD will use Kustomize to:

   * Read `a/b/yamls/kustomization.yaml`
   * Apply all listed resources, including the common `envconfigmap`

---

## ✅ Summary

| File                 | Purpose                                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `kustomization.yaml` | Declares which YAMLs to apply           |
| `application.yaml`   | Tells Argo CD to sync from the Git repo |
| `../../../...` path  | Pulls in shared config from other dirs  |
| Branch `brn`         | Argo CD will fetch from this branch     |
| Namespace `NSR`      | All resources deployed here             |
